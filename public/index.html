      <title>DDoS Detection using Machine Learning Methods</title>

      <description>Description DDoS Detection Using Machine Learning 1. What is DDoS? DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks overwhelm a target system (e.g., a server or website) with excessive traffic from multiple sources, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.&#xA;2. Why Use Machine Learning? Traditional detection methods, like rule-based systems, struggle to adapt to evolving attack patterns. Machine Learning (ML) provides a dynamic approach by analyzing traffic data and detecting anomalies in real-time.</description>
