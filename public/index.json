[{"content":"Intro In my video about How I cleared the AWS SAA Certification Exam, I shared my preparation strategy as well as tips to ace the exam. I also gave a glimpse of my revision notes that I prepared while taking the course and practice exams on Udemy. After that video was out, I got so many comments and DMs, requesting me to share my notes, but the problem was that I took these notes using a note-taking app called Obsidian which stores them in markdown format locally on my Mac. Once I\u0026rsquo;m done editing my notes, I push them to a GitHub repository to make sure I don\u0026rsquo;t lose them if my laptop breaks.\nSo, if you want to view my notes exactly like I do, you can clone my Obsidian Vault repository and download Obsidian to render it. But, this solution isn\u0026rsquo;t elegant as it would require you to download an additional software. So, I along with my college roommate, Sarthak Narayan, had been working over the past 2 weeks on the project, Obsidian Publish using GitHub Action, which would allow us to effortlessly publish our notes as a static website.\nIt is complete and I\u0026rsquo;ve used it to publish my notes at notes.arkalim.org. Working The GitHub Action spins up a Docker container which parses and converts Obsidian markdown notes into a special markdown format understood by MkDocs, an open-source static site generator. MkDocs is actually meant for preparing documentations but works well for notes too. After the markdown files have been converted, all the images in my notes are compressed to a fraction of their original size so that they can load quickly in your web browser. A static site is then built using MkDocs and then finally deployed on Netlify. All of this happens automatically using GitHub Actions. All I have to do is update my notes and push the changes to GitHub.\nFinal thoughts Having an automated way to publish your notes online with the community is a powerful way to share knowledge. This project has also made it exceedingly easy for me to refer my notes from anywhere, which is powerful when you work on a lot of systems.\nResources My Notes Obsidian Publish - GitHub Action Parser and Image Compressor MkDocs - Material Theme ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/obsidian-publish-github-action/","summary":"Intro In my video about How I cleared the AWS SAA Certification Exam, I shared my preparation strategy as well as tips to ace the exam.

Some of these books are downloaded straight from the internet and not from the Kindle store. I take highlights during my reading which I wanted to sync to my Notion workspace. There was no existing app that could do this job, so I developed my own.\nKindle exports the highlights as a file named MyClippings.txt. The NodeJS application reads the MyClipping.txt file exported by Kindle, parses it using Regex, extracts all the highlights, book names, highlight time etc and creates a JSON. It then uses Notion API to sync these highlights to a database in my Notion workspace. The app maintains a cache (JSON) containing the number of highlights synced for each book. This allows the highlights to be synced incrementally, preventing re-syncing of old highlights.\nAfter the app was received well by the open-source community and other developers contributed to improve the app, I dockerized it to make shipping the app easier. Now, the users donâ€™t have to install any dependency. They can just use the docker run command with the path to their clippings file along with their Notion API key and database ID. This would sync their highlights to their Notion database.\nAs a part of automation, I implemented auto build and deployment of containers on push to the master branch using GitHub Actions. If a developer raises a pull request and I merge it to the master branch, the GitHub workflow automatically builds the app and deploys it to GitHub packages repository.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/kindle-to-notion/","summary":"ðŸ”— GitHub Description I like reading personal improvement and mindset change type books on Kindle e-reader.

Resnet-18 was used as the model with some slight modifications to the input and output layer. The model was trained on the official DLib Dataset containing 6666 images along with corresponding 68-point landmarks for each face. Additionally, I wrote a custom data preprocessing pipeline in PyTorch to increase variance in the input images to help the model generalize better. The neural network was trained for 30 epochs before it reached the optima.\nDuring inference, OpenCV Harr Cascades are used to detect faces in the input images. Detected faces are then cropped, resized to (224, 224), and fed to our trained neural network to predict landmarks in them. The predicted landmarks in the cropped faces are then overlayed on top of the original image.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/face-landmarks-detection/","summary":"ðŸ”— Colab Notebook ðŸ”— Blog Post Description In this project, I trained a neural network to localize key points on faces.

Though disasters can never be prevented, their effects on mankind can surely be reduced. In this paper, we present the design and control of SRR (Search and Reconnaissance Robot), a robot capable of traversing on all terrains and locating survivors stuck under the debris. This will assist the rescue team to focus on recovering the victims, leaving the locating task for the Robots. The unique features of the SRR above existing ATVs are active-articulation, modularity, and assisted-autonomy. Active-articulation allows the SRR to climb objects much tall than itself. Modularity allows the SRR to detach into smaller modules to enter tight spaces where the whole body canâ€™t fit. Assisted-autonomy allows the SRR to detect the presence of objects in front and climb autonomously over them.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/search-and-reconnaissance-robot/","summary":"Presented in the 4th International and 19th National Conference on Machine and Mechanisms (iNaCoMM 2019)\nPublished in the Springer 2019\nðŸ”— Publication Description Natural disasters like earthquakes and landslides are sudden events that cause widespread destruction and major collateral damage including loss of life.
